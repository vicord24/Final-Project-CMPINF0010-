### Description of datasets
1. [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data)
   The arrest data provides information on individuals taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. It includes arrests for various offenses, from serious crimes like felonies to parole violations or failure to appear for trial. Data is reported at the block or intersection level, except for sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. It only covers arrests made by Pittsburgh Police and excludes those by other police departments operating within the city, such as campus or Port Authority police. 

2. [Sidewalk to Street "Walkability" Ratio](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio)
    This dataset is used to measure the "walkability" of communities in Allegheny County. The methodology involves cleaning and refining data to ensure accuracy, excluding features such as trails, crosswalks, limited-access highways, and alleyways, which could distort the walkability measure. The resulting ratio reflects pedestrian infrastructure, helping to assess and compare how walkable different neighborhoods are based on available sidewalks.

3. [Median 1-2 Unit Homes Median Price in 2021 $ by Tract](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/housing-indicators/resource/48a84ba8-194c-47f9-a5c0-d4098a43151d)
    This dataset provides the median sale prices of 1-2 unit homes in 2021, broken down by census tract. It offers insights into housing affordability and market trends at a localized level, helping to identify variations in home values across different neighborhoods or regions. This information is useful for urban planning, real estate analysis, and economic studies related to housing markets.

4. [Pittsburgh neighborhood cencus block](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php)
    This dataset provides the cencus block and tract information of each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It will provide the corresponding neighborhood by traversing through the cencus block. This information is needed to convert the Geographic ids to the corresponding neighborhood.


### Overview
This repository is designed to be used in collecting information of sidewalk walkability, arrest rates, and home value increases as an analysis progresses to the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. 
    [CMPINF0100_Alan]: This notebook from Alan provides the analysis of the arrest rates among each neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
    [CMPINF0100_Kevin]: This notebook from Kevin provides the analysis of the sidewalk walkability and home values for each neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
